# Smart Cart - React & Firebase demo app
## Summary

Smart Cart is a simple *CRUD* app. It was created with the intention to explore the minimum requirements  needed to setup a **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)** app and integrate it with the **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)** back-end solution.

Smart Cart  can be used as a web based grocery shopping list tool. It lets you add items to your *shopping cart* on your mobile device when on the go. You can also use it from the comfort of your home when planning your shopping list on a laptop's web browser.

**The app is by no means complete. Many features still need to be added to make it a viable solution. As an example, you can “Sign up” and sign in. However, the facility to change your password is missing.**
